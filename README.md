# STARFIRE â€“ Simulation of TerrestriAl Radio Frequency Interference in oRbits around Earth

STARFIRE provides a framework to evaluate radio frequency interference (RFI) levels in the FM band at different altitudes and locations around Earth for low frequency cosmological experiments at radio wavelength.  This algorithm can be used for any application that may require an understanding of the RFI environment in Earth-orbit, as desired by the end-user, and maybe readily be extended to other range of frequency based on the availability of datasets.
